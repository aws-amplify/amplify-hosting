# AWS Amplify Hosting Feature Tracker

Welcome the Amplify Hosting Feature Request Tracker! [AWS Amplify Hosting](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/hosting) is a fully managed hosting service for modern web apps on AWS.  We use this board to communicate with our customers on which feature requests we are currently working on, and which ones we are discussing internally. Please feel free to open new Feature Requests on our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-hosting) and upvote/comment on existing ones.

## Feature request status

Features are grouped by status. We use the following status fields to represent the state of the issue:
1. **Up for consideration:** We are considering working on this feature this year.
2. **In progress:** Our engineering team is actively working on the feature.
3. **Done:** The feature has rolled out to all available regions.

If a feature request you're looking at does not have a status, this usually means that we are not actively considering it to work on this year.
